## OpenCV ##

The benchmark has been tested with opencv 2.4.6.1. There is a bug in opencv-2.4.6.1 which results in a deadlock when initializing the OpenCL context. There is a patch in the repository called 

opencv-2.4.6.1_autolock_and_gpuimg.patch

this patch needs to be applied before building OpenCV. 

## CMake ##

The benchmark has to be built with CMake. During the configuration each 

test_*.cpp 

will be converted into a target executable. 

*.cl 

files will be precompiled into .clh string headers.

By convention all PENCIL source files should be called 

*.pencil.c

OpenCL operators are preprocessed with 

xxd

This executable has to be accessible to make during the compilation. 

## Repository Structure ##

The repository has a modular structure where each test is called 

test_"operator name"

Each executable tests a single operator, but can test all the implementations of it. 

## Development ##

The git repository should be kept in a feature-branch format, where each new operator from now gets a new branch named after the operator. Once the operator is working the feature branch should be merged back in master and deleted. Examples

git clone ... 
git checkout featurename
git commit 
git push origin featurename
git commit
git push origin featurename
...
git commit
git push origin featurename

git checkout master
git merge featurename
# testing everything works
# hey laszlo a new feature has been included, you can delete the obsolete branch

## Pool ##

The input dataset for the tests is stored in directory 

pool

the content of pool should be extracted into directory

build_dir/pool
