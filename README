 For compiling and running the test You are going to need OpenCV
(tested with 2.4.2) and boost.

The input data for mlp testing is stored in file
'response_dumps.xml.7z'. You have to decompress it before the benchmark. 

There are makefile parameters which can be set in order to compile the
benchmark. Look into the makefile. 

The most interesting files in the mlp benchmark are 
mlp_impl.c
mlp_impl.cl
